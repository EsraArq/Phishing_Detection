Dataset Information:
Source: Public dataset on Kaggle
Size: 18,650 websites
7,313 phishing websites
11,322 legitimate websites
Types of Features: URL-based and content-based features. Detailed analysis ensured balanced representation of classes by undersampling, resulting in 7,312 instances for both phishing and legitimate categories​​.
Feature Sets and Engineering Techniques:
TF-IDF Vectorization: Used to transform raw email texts into structured format. This technique emphasizes the importance of words in the context of the entire email corpus​​.
Model Configuration and Parameters:
SVM:
Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF)
Regularization Parameter (C): 10
Gamma: Set to 'scale'
Parameter Tuning: Cross-validation with 16 different combinations over 5 folds (totaling 80 fits) to discover the best parameters​​.
RFC:
Number of Trees (n_estimators): 10
Training Method: Each tree is constructed using a random subset of features and training data
Parameter Tuning: Iterative trials with parameters adjusted based on cross-validation performance​​.
Evaluation Methods:
Validation Dataset: Split from the original data
Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Tools: Python’s scikit-learn library
Visualization: Confusion matrices used to visualize performance and pinpoint misclassifications​​.
